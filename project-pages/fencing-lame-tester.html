        <div class="project-details-content">
          <div class="body-text">The purpose of this project was to design and fabricate a low-cost alternative for a conductive probe to test the electrical resistance of metal-woven jackets used in the sport 
            of fencing. Commercially available probes which are used for this testing cost anywhere between $60 - $150, while the tester made for this project cost a fraction of that.The part was designed in 
            Solidworks, and machined using a combination of a CNC and manual lathe in the COE machine shop under the guidance of Kirk Fields, P.E.. The point for electrical connectivity was manually tapped, and the probe was connected to a multimeter 
            with a standard banana plug cable. The probe was used to check the resistance across different points of the fencing jackets by connecting the multimeter with an alligator clip on one end, and dragging 
            the probe across the jackets to look for areas of increased or infinite resistance. Seen above is a part drawing of the probe.
          </div>

          <div class="body-text">Design features were motivated by ease of use of the probe, and by governing rules for standard fencing testing equipment. The governing body for international fencing is the The 
            International Fencing Federation (FIE), which sets forth a set of rules for competitive and equipment control rules. Section m.28.5 of “Rules for Competitions Fencers’ Weapons and Equipment Control” 
            states: “The electrical resistance measured between any two points of the lame material must not be greater than 5 ohms. The resistance will be measured by using a 500 g conductive metal weight which 
            has a hemispherical end with a radius of 4 mm. This weight, placed on this end and moved about on the lamé, must maintain continuous contact with a maximum resistance of 5 ohms.” 
          </div>

          <div class="body-text"> The material selected for this project was 6061 Aluminum because of its affordability, ease of manufacturing, and high electrical conductivity. However, because this material is also 
          relatively lightweight, the height of the probe would have had to be unreasonably high to achieve the standard 500 g weight, so a new target weight of 175 g was set. The reason for this was that this probe 
          was meant for use at home or in a fencing club, not for armorers and equipment control administrators at a competition. Therefore, to maximize affordability and to lower production costs, choosing aluminum 
          over a heavier material like stainless steel was justified.
          </div>

          <div class="body-text">While designing for a target weight of 175 g and a tip radius of 4 mm (about 0.16 in), the overall height was set to 3.1 in, and the diameter for the area to be held by was set to 
            1.45 in. The height was selected based on ergonomic considerations, and the diameter was set based on the 1.5 in outer diameter of the stock material. The angle of the pointed section of the probe 
            resulted from a line tangent to the radius of the tip and coincident with the OD of the grip. The connection point was initially designed for a M6x0.75 banana plug, but was later changed in favor of a 
            standard M6x0.1 banana plug. The reason for having a removable connector was for increasing the longevity of the probe. Repeated insertion and removal of the plug without the threaded connector would 
            wear down the probe, increasing the inner diameter of the hole and decreasing contact area for the wire. When the connector fails, a new one can be installed in its place.

                for competition. The state of the jackets was also verified by historical use and observation: jackets that failed the probe test also did not register hits in practice, and had visible corrosion in 
                areas that failed testing. Additionally, using the probe revealed jackets that had a resistance higher than 5 Ohms, but seemed to work in practice. </span>

                my fencing club. Commerical testers can go for upwards of $60, and the product I ended up making cost roughly $6 by weight. Even the cost of the stock was $21, which was a third of the price of a 
                commercial tester.
