          <div class="body-text">The first project I worked on was testing different configurations for strings on an inflatable arm. The goal for this was to quantify the force needed to 
            accomplish lifting-related tasks of the arm, and minimize friction by optimizing string routing and selecting smooth tubing for the strings. As a part of this, I designed and 3D printed a base for 
            the arm that could be fixed with clamps, and I also made a copy of the arm because the material of the arm degraded with repeated applications of tape. The arm was tested in a variety of 
            configurations and tube arrangements with different masses attached to the end.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">The goal of my second project was to make a jig for testing inflatable shoe pods and collecting data to be automatically processed in Matlab. I did this by designing an adapter for the 
            linear rail guide of the force gauge. The adapter connected to four existing bolt holes, and was used to squish the pods using the force gauge to collect force data. Additionally, the internal pressure of 
            the arm was measured using a pressure gauge, and these pressure readings were recorded by video.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">My third project was improving the experimental setup of a tubular motor to be used for testing various sand jumper accessories. The most recent project I worked on at the time of 
            writing was simulating a 2D coin flip. This was inspired by the paper on the 
            <a href="https://la.disneyresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/Falling-with-Style-Sticking-the-Landing-by-Controlling-Spin-during-Ballistic-Flight-Paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 
            Disney Brick</a>, and the paper on 
            <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2323340?origin=JSTOR-pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Probability of Heads</a>,
            Heads. Both of these papers studied methods to predict the final orientation of a rotating object in freefall. In summary, the Disney Brick experienced freefall in the z axis (vertical direction) while 
            rotating in the xy plane (horizontally); the objective of the brick was to slow down its rotational motion in order to land in a preferred position after some time. The brick was able to land correctly 
            with different initial conditions using predictive control. The Probability of Heads paper was a more theoretical exploration of this concept, which in summary resulted in a neat graph that illustrated 
            the result of a coin flip for various initial vertical and rotational speeds.

              <span class="image-caption">I was able to faithfully recreate the figure from the coin flip paper, demonstrating that the development of this simulation was possible. Additionally, I added a 
                colormapping which related the angle of the coin to its initial conditions for flipping. This was done by tracking the final angle of the coin when it “fell” on the ground.

              <span class="image-caption"> The next stage was to add two masses to the coin, and develop a controller that would extend the masses in order to land on only one side consistently, regardless of intial 
                conditions. This works on the principle of conservation of angular momentum, similar to how gymnasts and figure skaters are able to slow themselves down after a spinning move by extending their arms. 
                The controller I made starts predicting the final landing angle of the coin after it reaches its apex height, and extends the masses when the predicted angle is close to the desired final angle. The 
                video shown above demonstrates this functionality.

              <span class="image-caption">A bang bang controller was successfully able to make the coin land on only one side for most initial conditions. Interestingly, it was not able to change the result of 
                the coin toss for low initial rotational speeds, and low initial vertical speeds. The reason for this is that the masses are only able to move out with a bang bang controller, and so the coin is only 
                able to slow down its rotation. If the coin already starts rotating slowly or does not gain enough height to impactfully influence the rotation due to “slow” initial conditions, the controller is 
                unable to change the result with certainty.
