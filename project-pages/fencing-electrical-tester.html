          <div class="body-text">This is my main passion project to make an inexpensive electrical tester for fencing equipment, namely blades and body cords. I initially started this project because I wanted 
            something to make my own work easier at the UCSB Fencing Club, where I was the armorer and repaired most things, but I kept going to learn new technologies for myself and maybe commercialize this as a 
            product. Existing professional testers are very expensive for the purpose that they serve for student athletes, while the next best thing is a multimeter which is a hassle to use.
          </div>
          <div class="body-text">In fencing, there are three different types of blades: Foil, Epee, and Sabre. For these blades, there are two different types of body cords: Epee cords, and Foil/Sabre cords. 
            Each kind has three wires, but one side of the wires has a different connection. Pictured below are the two kinds:
          </div>

            <!-- <span class="image-caption">Give your image a caption. People love context.</span> -->
          </div>


          <div class="body-text">The two main faults a body cord can have is a faulty connection at a prong, or a break somewhere along the wire. Testing this is easy by looking for electrical continuity in the wire. 
            With a multimeter, this can be done by looking at the resistance of the wire: very low resistance indicates a good connection, and very high resistance or no connection indicates a fault. However, this is 
            time consuming and finicky, as a user has to manually hold the leads of a multimeter to the prongs of a wire. Testing blades works in a similar way, but will not be discussed because it is different for 
            each weapon.
          </div>

          <div class="body-text">What my design accomplishes is streamlining the testing of all three wires in a body cord, so it can be done at the same time with one device. Additionally, my design integrates blade 
            testing functionality so that a user wouldn't have to purchase a separate product for that purpose. Below are some commercially available products with prices. The product in the middle is what I am 
            trying to emulate.

                well as switching between different modes for different testing scenarios.
