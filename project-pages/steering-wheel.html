          <div class="body-text">I led this group project, where my group and I received a $1000 grant to design and fabricate an ergonomic and high-strength steering wheel for an FSAE vehicle. FEA simulations 
            were done in Solidworks to simulate stresses on the aluminum backplate of the assembly, which were also verified with hand calculations. The grips and electronics housing were 3D printed out of a clear 
            resin, providing a neat aesthetic and functionality at the same time.</div>
          <div class="body-text">For defining a load case, we used data given in an article by an FSAE Design Judge from designjudges.com, which collected data on maximum force applied on steering wheels. Based on 
            FEA simulations using this load case, a 0.25 in thickness was selected for the Aluminum backplate, which provided a balance of strength and weight.</div>
          <div class="body-text">My main contributions were conducting and analyzing FEA simulations, advising the design process for the resin shell and 3D printing prototypes for ergonomic testing, and testing 
            hardware compatibility. Working with our advisor, Professor Robert McMeeking, to perform FEA simulations strengthened my knowledge of computational analysis and the math behind it.</div>
