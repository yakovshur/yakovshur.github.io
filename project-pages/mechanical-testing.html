          <div class="body-text">I led this group project, where my group and I received a $2100 grant to test a composite sandwich material for an FSAE race car seat. To achieve a lightweight and 
            strong product, expanding foam was used for the core of the material, and resin infused fiberglass was used for the shell. We aimed for 2 types of tests, bending and shear stress, with three 
            categories of number of layers of fiberglass on each side of the foam core. We conducted the bending tests with Kirk Fields, P.E., with a two point load in an MTS load frame to maximize the area where failure could occur.</div>
          <div class="body-text">My main contributions were writing a Standard Operating Procedure for working with fiberglass, resin, and vacuum bagging, and making the test samples. We used vacuum bagging 
            to make the samples because of the even distribution of resin in the fiberglass it would yield. Writing the SOP taught me how to write documentation with integrated feedback, and making the samples 
            taught me how to manufacture with vacuum bagging.</div>
