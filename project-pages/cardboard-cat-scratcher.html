            project for myself. This project was a fun way for me to learn more about designing for laser cutting, and practice surface modeling in Solidworks. Below is my process for this project.</div>

              - To add an image to the this area, copy one of the above, paste it below this comment, and change the following:
                  - IMAGE_NAME: the name of the image file in assets/images
                  - IMAGE_CAPTION: to the caption of the image

              <span class="image-caption">I started out by making a 3D model in Solidworks. The design is parametric, driven by a few key constraints like the depth of the bowl, and the width and length of the 
                base. There are also holes in the base for dowels used for aligning the layers of cardboard.</span>

              <img src="../assets/images/cat scratcher/sliced cad.png" class="gallery-image">
              <span class="image-caption">I used a free software called Slicer for Fusion 360 to split the 3D model into layers equal to the thickness of cardboard I got from recycled shipping boxes. Coincidentally 
                I got 100 layers, which I then exported as .dxf files to be cut out on the laser cutter at the UCSB Makerspace.</span>

              <span class="image-caption">I spent a lot of time at the laser for all of the layers to be cut out. If I were to make this again, I would look for an 
                alternative cutting method because the fringes in the cardboard retained a burned smell for quite a while. However, once it went away the result was better than I expected.</span>

              <span class="image-caption">Once the smell had subsided even more, the new user of this scratcher started showing some interest. If I were to make this again, I would definitely use another tool to 
                cut the cardboard, I would try to make the scratcher bigger (provided I have enough cardboard to do so).
