          <div class="body-text">In this course, we learned how to design, build, and program autonomous robots to accomplish specific tasks. The bodies of the robots were made out of legos, and the basic 
            electrical hardware included: DC motors, servos, break beam sensors, reflective sensors, range sensors, limit switches, light sensors, batteries, and an Arduino Uno with a motor shield. Though the 
            Arduino is not a great platform for robots, its limited capabilities served as a good base for the projects, and actually led to lessons in how data is processed stored. Apart from learning to work with 
            the afore mentioned hardware, working on the projects gave valubale lessons on brainstorming, concept selection, teamwork and communication.

          <div class="body-text">Seen above is the layout of the board on which robots had to perform. On either side of the board is an LED panel, the illumination of which initiates the robot's program.
            The surface of the board was painted white with black lines, and foam cubes were placed on the board depending on the project. Throughout the course there were three projects: obstacle avoidance, cube 
            delivery, and the "RoboRat". Each project built upon the previous assignment, with new challenges for building a robot to accomplish each new task.

                also one of, if not the most gruelling. I learned about mechanical design, mechatronic integration, and definitely a lot about making design choices and teamwork.
